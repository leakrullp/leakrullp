**Welcome!** 🫶🏻

I have a background in design and as a software development student, I am learning the tools to my ideas into life. I have a particular interest in object-oriented programming, front-end development, multi-platform and native app development and the software engineering process. I am well-versed in programming with Java, Python, SQL, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am currently...
- learning React (with Vite)
- working on [ITU Invited](https://github.com/leakrullp/itu-invited) with my teammates.
